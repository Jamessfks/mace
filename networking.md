**Email progress from Founders of MACE**

---First email:
Dear Zicheng,


Thank you for sharing your web interface – it is fantastic to see such initiative, and we are excited by the possibilities it opens up for MACE users.



We would love to try it out and see how it performs in practice. At the moment, trying at the URL gives us an error. Is it possible to try it out locally? 



One idea that could make the tool even more useful is to include an optional visualisation of the uploaded structure. This would help users quickly catch any huge or unexpected structures before the site gets overwhelmed. Perhaps this could appear only when requested (a simple click-to-display option), and you might even reuse the same widget we currently employ in the ml-peg tool, that is a testing framework for ML potentials that we are developing.

Here is the link to ml-peg for reference:

https://github.com/ddmms/ml-peg



In the future, it could be really fun to connect the two tools, so that users could select a structure directly from the ml-peg menu instead of uploading a new one.



Looking forward to seeing the next iteration!



Best regards,

Ilyes

---Second email:

Csányi:

Nice ! I guess without a GPU at the backend, one can’t do too many interesting things (e.g. geometry optimisation). I will discuss with Ilyes soon about your contribution. 

I selected “aspirin” from the ml-peg molecular benchmark, but something is wrong, because this molecule is not aspirin (and on the right hand side the atomic configuration is nonsensical)
