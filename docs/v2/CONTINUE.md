## The method

Every piece has a **bar** — a real, fetchable thing — a **builder**, and a separate **critic**
with fresh context whose job is to find reasons ours is worse. A piece is done only when the
critic picks ours. Not a score; a pick. The exit is winning, or the user calling it.

**Score: 2 of 13 winning blind.** That counter is deliberately strict and says nothing about
the ~20 scientific defects fixed along the way, which is where most of the value landed. Both
numbers are shown on `/v2` for that reason.

| Won | Why it won |
|---|---|
| **Navigation** | One chrome width site-wide. The critic measured Rowan using the same `max-w-7xl` + `px-6` with the logo at x=24 and h1 at x=144.5 — a 120.5px offset against our 121px. Full-bleed chrome over a narrower column is the bar's own pattern. We also set `aria-current` on the active route; Rowan sets it on none of its five top links. |
| **Viewer selection & measurement** | Every displayed value hand-checked against the raw XYZ. Bond length in Å, angle in degrees with the vertex named, signed dihedral, order setting vertex and sign. Two atoms read `Bond length` only when a bond was actually perceived; otherwise `Distance` with the distinction stated. The bar makes no such distinction and does not name the vertex. |

## The three bars

| Bar | Judges | Fetchable? |
|---|---|---|
| [Rowan](https://rowansci.com) | Interface, 3D viewer | Marketing site **and their live production viewer** are public. App job/results screens are **behind login**. |
| [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-149) | Data density, numeric reference | Property data public. Interactive crystal viewer **behind login**. |
| [ACEsuit/mace](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) | Scientific correctness | Fully public. Where SimpleAtom disagrees with upstream, SimpleAtom is wrong by definition. |

Details and measured tokens in `docs/v2/bars/`. **Only Rowan's viewer is genuinely interactive
and public** — a critic judging the job-config or results screens is working from docs prose
and must say so. That is the most common way this method fails.

Public viewer embed (the real bar, no login):

## In flight when this was written

Three agents were running. Check `git log` before redoing any of it.

1. **Critic, round 6** — judging viewer render, gear menu, landing, results panel, provenance.
   The results panel and provenance had **never been judged**. Two fixes were unmeasured:
   whether toggling force vectors now changes molecule size by zero pixels, and whether the
   pan direction in the asymmetry fix is correct.
2. **Builder — MACE Link share piece** (`app/r/[id]/`). Never started. The bar ships this
   primitive publicly and embeds it in its own homepage, so the comparison is direct.
3. **Builder — benchmark vs MP** (`app/benchmark/`, `components/benchmark/`,
   `lib/mlpeg-catalog.ts`). Never started. Supplies the numeric half of the bar.

## Pieces never started

| Piece | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Mobile / responsive** | Rowan's own mobile is weak — their hero molecule clips off-screen. Winnable. Known issues: 21 interactive targets under 44×44 (partly addressed in the viewer), nav links 17px tall. |
| **Reference conformance** | Round 1 shipped. Findings 6, 7 (done), 9, 10, 11 (done), 12 from `docs/v2/audit-vs-acesuit.md` remain. |

## Known defects, deliberately unfixed

- **`mace-api/main.py` returns HTTP 500 instead of 400** for a rejected `calculationType`, so
  the hosted FastAPI path reports the wrong status.
- **The validator is absent from the deployed container.** `mace-api/Dockerfile`'s build
  context is `mace-api/`, so `COPY . .` cannot reach `../test_scripts/`. Hosted results report
  `validation.status: "unavailable"` — degrading correctly, but degraded.
- **Audit finding 8**: the foundation-model comparison picks its baseline by substring-matching
  the uploaded *filename* for `"off"`/`"organic"` (`app/calculate/page.tsx` ~259). This can
  silently compare across two incompatible energy conventions.
- **Audit finding 6**: geometry-opt trajectories contain a duplicated frame 0 with off-by-one
  step labels — the message and the trajectory contradict each other.
- **Audit finding 10**: upstream computes stress on every call and it is discarded;
  `properties.pressure` is declared and never populated.
- `lattice` and `properties.volume` are declared non-nullable but the backend sends `null` for
  both on non-periodic systems.
- ASE's `get_temperature()` divides by 3N even with COM momentum pinned, so reported
  temperature reads ~11% low for a 9-atom molecule. The MD chart shows it as-is.
- **Force arrows are still drawn for hidden C–H hydrogens**, leaving arrows with no visible
  atom at their base.
- `components/ui/card.tsx`'s `CardHeader` is a bare grid with no explicit columns unless a
  `CardAction` child is present — the same unsafe pattern that caused the `/calculate` mobile
  overflow, one level deeper. `ResultsSkeleton` has it too, currently inert.
- **Viewer framing** still sits a few percent under the 0.82 target.

## The pattern worth remembering

Six defects in this work were **code that reviews as correct and does nothing, or the wrong
thing, at runtime**. None would be caught by reading a diff:

1. `calculationType` had no allow-list — any unrecognised type ran a single-point and returned
   it as the requested calculation.
2. `modelType` had no allow-list — "custom" with no checkpoint returned MACE-MP-0 results
   labelled `custom`, shareable and PDF-exportable.
3. The validator's model-aware energy bounds were dead because `_build_result()` never echoed
   the `params` the validator reads.
4. The D3 toggle was live but a no-op for custom models, whose loader takes no dispersion arg.
5. The MACE-OFF element and NPT periodicity guards were implemented but inert — nothing passed
   them the structure.
6. **Ambient occlusion had never once rendered.** The WebGL2 check probed the visible canvas,
   which holds a `bitmaprenderer` context whenever the viewer renders offscreen, so the check
   failed on every capable machine.

And two found only by asking a downstream question:
- `parseCIF` never converted fractional coordinates — silicon loaded with a **0.433 Å**
  nearest-neighbour distance instead of 2.3516 Å. Found only because wiring `isPeriodic` forced
  "where is the lattice?"
- The default result viewer fitted force-arrow **tips**, so the molecule rendered at ~12% of
  the box. Found only because a critic ran a real calculation; every prior check measured the
  *hero* viewer, which has no arrows.

**Verify by execution, never by reading.** Also verify the *right build* — one critic spent a
full run measuring a stale branch because the dev server was serving different code than the
branch under test.

## Resuming

```bash
git checkout -b v2.2 main
npm install && npm run dev          # dashboard at /v2
```

Gates that must stay green:

```bash
npm run build                                        # must compile
npx eslint .                                         # ~37 known pre-existing problems
export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE                     # else OMP Error #15
python3 test_scripts/validate_calculation.py --test  # all_passed: true
python3 -m unittest discover -s test_scripts -p "test_provenance.py"   # 40 tests
```

Guards that must keep failing loudly. If any returns a result, a silent fallthrough is back:

```bash
python3 mace-api/calculate_local.py public/demo/ethanol.xyz '{"calculationType":"phonon"}'
python3 mace-api/calculate_local.py public/demo/ethanol.xyz '{"modelType":"custom"}'
python3 mace-api/calculate_local.py public/demo/ethanol.xyz '{"modelType":"MACE-MP"}'
```

And the CIF fixture, which regresses to a 1 Å box if fractional handling breaks:
`public/demo/silicon.cif` — correct nearest-neighbour is **2.3516 Å** (a·√3/4).

### Harness traps that cost real time

- **Coordinate clicks in the browser pane are scaled ~3.4952×.** A ref-based click reports page
  coords but lands at 3.5× that point. Click via `javascript_tool` (`el.click()`) instead.
- Injecting `input.files` + a native `change` event does **not** trigger React's handler. Load
  structures through the UI (Catalog, SMILES, or `?demo=true`).
- Concurrent `npm run build` from parallel agents shares `.next/` and produces spurious lock
  failures. Treat an agent's build result as advisory; run one authoritative build yourself.
- Verify the dev server is serving the branch you think it is before judging anything.
