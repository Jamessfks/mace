"""
Calculation manifest — the audit trail attached to every result.

The question this module answers is: *can a third party reproduce and verify
any number this app displays, months later, without asking us?*

"MACE-OFF small" is not a reproducible identifier. It names a download URL
whose contents can change, is resolved through a cache whose filenames are
sometimes opaque (`~/.cache/mace/5yyxdm76`), and says nothing about the
mace-torch / torch / ASE versions that turned those weights into a number.
Upstream publishes no checksums for the foundation-model weights, so the only
way to pin which weights produced a result is to hash the file that was
actually loaded.

That is what this module records, as `result["provenance"]`:

    schemaVersion   bump when the shape changes
    timestampUtc    when the run finished being set up
    model           family, size, and the SHA256 of the checkpoint file that
                    torch.load() actually opened — not the requested name
    packages        mace-torch, torch, ase, numpy versions
    input           filename, format, SHA256 of the file bytes, and a
                    format-independent SHA256 of the parsed structure
    runtime         device, precision, MD seed, python, platform
    code            git commit of the checkout, and whether it was dirty
    paramsRef       pointer to result["params"], which already carries the
                    effective parameters — they are not duplicated here
    notes           one line for every field that came back null, saying why

Three rules this module holds to:

1. **Never fabricate.** Every field is either a measured value or `null` with
   a matching entry in `notes`. A plausible-looking hash is worse than no hash.
2. **Never cost anything.** Hashing a 134 MB checkpoint takes ~0.06 s and a
   7 MB one ~0.003 s, against a multi-second MACE run. Results are cached per
   process, keyed on (path, size, mtime), so a repeat run in the FastAPI
   server pays nothing at all.
3. **Never leak a server path.** Only basenames are recorded. A manifest
   travels into shared MACE Links and PDF exports; `/Users/<name>/.cache/...`
   does not belong in either. This follows the rule `calculate.py` already
   applies to `customModelName`.

    `MACECalculator` does not keep the path it loaded from — its attributes are

    which is not a contract worth parsing. But every loader route

    the same line inside `MACECalculator.__init__`:
