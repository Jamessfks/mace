/**
 * Materials Project comparison — the numeric half of SimpleAtom's quality bar.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING MEASURED
 *   For each compound in the MP reference set we form a formation energy from
 *   the benchmark run's own MACE energies:
 *
 *     E_f = [ E(compound) - SUM_i n_i * e_ref(element_i) ] / N_atoms
 *
 *   and compare it against the value the Materials Project publishes for the
 *   same mp-id in its `gga_gga+u` (PBE / PBE+U) thermo dataset.
 *
 * WHY NOT TOTAL ENERGIES
 *   MP total energies come from VASP with PAW reference states; MACE has its
 *   own absolute scale. The two numbers are not on the same axis and never
 *   will be. Only formation energies and energy differences are comparable.
 *
 * WHY e_ref MUST COME FROM THE SAME RUN
 *   A formation energy is only meaningful if the elemental references were
 *   computed with the same model as the compound. Mixing a MACE compound
 *   energy with an MP elemental reference silently smuggles the entire
 *   VASP-vs-MACE offset into the answer. So this module refuses to invent
 *   e_ref: it reads the elemental reference phases out of the same benchmark
 *   batch, at the same model and settings, and if one is absent the row is
 *   reported unscored with the missing element named.
 *
 * WHAT AGREEMENT DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE
 *   MACE-MP-0 was trained on Materials Project PBE data. Agreement therefore
 *   measures how well the model reproduces PBE — its own training target — and
 *   says nothing about agreement with experiment. PBE itself carries roughly
 *   0.1-0.5 eV/atom of overbinding against measured energetics.
 *
 * See docs/v2/bars/materials-project.md for the caveats this module enforces,
 * and test_scripts/fetch_mp_reference.py for how the reference data is built
 * and re-checked offline.
