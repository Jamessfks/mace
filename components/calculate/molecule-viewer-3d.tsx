/**
 * MoleculeViewer3D — Dual-engine 3D structure viewer.
 *
 * VIEWER ENGINES:
 *   1. 3Dmol.js (npm) — Full-featured: representations, force vectors, spin,
 *      atom selection + geometry measurement, C–H hiding, PNG export.
 *   2. WEAS (CDN) — Matches ml-peg (https://github.com/ddmms/ml-peg).
 *      Used for compatibility with the MACE team's ecosystem.
 *      See: https://github.com/superstar54/weas
 *
 * The user can toggle between the two engines via a button in the toolbar.
 * Both engines receive the same XYZ data built from the CalculationResult.
 *
 * NOTE ON FORCE VECTORS:
 *   Only 3Dmol.js supports force arrow overlays. When WEAS is active, the
 *   force toggle button is disabled.
 *
 * RENDER QUALITY CONTRACT (see docs/v2/bars/rowan.md):
 *   1. Retina — the WebGL backing store is always >= 2x the CSS box.
 *      3Dmol's Renderer.setSize() reads window.devicePixelRatio and, when
 *      `upscale` is on, floors it at 2. Both `antialias` and `upscale` are
 *      passed EXPLICITLY below so this does not depend on a library default.
 *      setSize() only runs from viewer.resize(), which 3Dmol fires on CSS-box
 *      changes only — so we additionally watch devicePixelRatio itself
 *      (see watchPixelRatio) and re-resize when it changes with no relayout
 *      (browser zoom, dragging the window to a display of different density).
 *   2. Framing — the ATOMS are measured in screen space and fitted to
 *      TARGET_FILL of the canvas. 3Dmol's own zoomTo() leaves a small molecule
 *      at ~28% and cannot be corrected with a constant (see the framing block
 *      below). The fit is re-solved on every size change, including entering
 *      and leaving fullscreen. Force arrows are an overlay, not the subject:
 *      they are excluded from the fit and bounded in length instead, by a
 *      measured screen-space ceiling (ARROW_TIP_SAFE_FILL). The fit also
 *      RE-CENTRES on the projected bounding box, so a lopsided silhouette still
 *      fills the frame. Auto-rotation solves the SAME fit and then checks the
 *      swept volume as a CEILING (SWEEP_SAFE_FILL), so the spinning and still
 *      framings are identical wherever the sweep already fits — which for the
 *      default view it does.
 *   3. Shading — renderer-level dark contact outline + screen-space ambient
 *      occlusion, so overlapping atoms separate and contacts darken.
 *   4. Colours — Jmol CPK (C grey, H off-white, N blue, O red), with a
 *      luminance ceiling so nothing renders at the background colour. 3Dmol's
 *      built-in default is the washed-out RasMol table (C #C8C8C8, N #8F8FFF).
 *   5. Background — the canvas is TRANSPARENT (backgroundAlpha 0), so the
 *      molecule sits on whatever surface hosts the component instead of on an
 *      opaque rectangle of its own. This component therefore draws no card and
 *      no well: its callers own the surface. PNG export composites onto an
 *      opaque colour before download (see handleDownloadPng).
 *   6. Shape — the viewer box is `aspect-square` (capped in height), not a
 *      fixed 420 px. A fixed height makes a phone-width box 291x420 portrait,
 *      where a correct fit binds on the 291 px axis and leaves 45% of the box
 *      empty. The bar uses `aspect-square w-full max-w-md`.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES:
 *   - 3dmol (npm)         — dynamically imported for 3Dmol.js mode
 *   - weas (CDN via iframe) — loaded at runtime for WEAS mode
 *   - ./weas-viewer.tsx   — WEAS iframe wrapper component

// centroid, so the floor wins outright and the molecule occupies ~28% of the
// short axis. It also ignores orientation: a flat molecule seen face-on gets
// the same fit as edge-on.
//
// Rather than multiplying by a constant (right for 9 atoms, clips at 75), the

 * Fraction of the binding axis the silhouette should span.
 *
 * WHY 0.82, AND WHY THE OLD 0.76 WAS CALIBRATED AGAINST A WRONG NUMBER:
 * this constant used to read "Bar measures 0.739" — a figure that appears
 * nowhere in docs/v2/bars/rowan.md and carries no record of the box it was
 * measured in. Fill on the binding axis is aspect-dependent, so a number
 * without its aspect ratio is not a target. The measurement that IS recorded
 * (docs/v2/progress.json) has the bar at 0.825 on its binding axis in an
 * 824x840 backing buffer — a 412x420 CSS box at DPR 2, byte-identical to the
 * buffer this component gets in the hero. So 0.76 was not "just under the
 * bar": it was 3% over an unattributed number and 8% under the only
 * attributed one.
 *
 * 0.82, not 0.825, because the remaining 18% of the box has to absorb things
 * the solver deliberately does not measure:
 *   - the contact outline, ~2 CSS px per side (OUTLINE.maxpixels);
 *   - the selection halo, which is +SELECTION_HALO_PAD (0.10 A) outside the
 *     drawn atom and is NOT re-framed when you click, so it must fit in the
 *     margin — ~4 px on spacefill, ~8 px on stick at a typical fit;
 *   - FRAMING_TOLERANCE, up to 0.5% of the fit;
 *   - the bar's own 0.825 being a single-aspect measurement of a single
 *     molecule. Matching it to three digits would be calibrating to noise for
 *     the second time.
 * At 412 CSS px that leaves ~37 px of margin per side on the binding axis,
 * against a worst case of roughly 10 px. Nothing above is aspect-dependent:
 * the solver takes min(width constraint, height constraint), so the binding
 * axis lands on TARGET_FILL and the other axis lands below it, at any shape
 * of box.
 *
 * Force arrows are NOT in that list. They are an overlay and are allowed to
 * overflow the frame; their length is clamped instead so the overflow stays
 * bounded (MAX_FORCE_ARROW_FRACTION).
 *
 * FORMERLY A "KNOWN LIMIT", NOW FIXED — see frameView(): zoomTo() centres the
 * atoms' CENTROID (getExtent()[2] is the mean of the coordinates), which is not
 * the centre of the PROJECTED silhouette at an arbitrary rotation, and the old
 * solver fitted a
 * centre-symmetric envelope so that neither side could crop. A structure whose
 * projected bbox centre sat far from that point therefore landed below
 * TARGET_FILL by exactly the asymmetry (measured: hiding five C–H hydrogens on
 * ethanol dropped the fill from 0.806 to 0.591 — a declutter control that made
 * the subject smaller). The old note here claimed the correction required
 * panning the model off 3Dmol's rotation centre. That is true of
 * translateScene(), which moves modelGroup INSIDE rotationGroup and therefore
 * turns rotate() into an orbit; it is not true of rotationGroup's own x/y
 * offset, which is applied AFTER the rotation quaternion. frameView() uses the
 * latter, so the molecule still turns about its own centre.

/**
 * ROTATION SAFETY, AND WHY IT IS A CEILING RATHER THAN A FILL TARGET.
 *
 * A silhouette fit is correct for exactly one orientation. Rotating the
 * structure changes its projected extent, so a static per-orientation fit
 * drifts: measured over 32 samples of a spin, the fill swung 0.7365 to 0.9221 —
 * up to 12% OVER TARGET_FILL, which is the direction that clips.
 *
 * The previous fix swapped the fit for a rotation-invariant envelope WHILE
 * SPINNING, and fitted that envelope to TARGET_FILL. It delivered no clipping
 * at any angle, and it cost 27% of the apparent size the instant the rotation
 * was engaged — measured 843 px static against 593-663 px spinning, with the
 * molecule popping back when the spin stopped. Two different envelopes fitted
 * to the same target CANNOT agree; that is arithmetic, not tuning. Reproduced
 * here from the geometry alone: ethanol's centroid-centred bounding sphere is
 * 4.196 A across where its silhouette is 3.07 A, so a sphere fitted to 0.82
 * lands the silhouette at 0.60 — a 26.8% shrink, which is the measurement.
 *
 * TWO CHANGES, AND WHICH ONE MATTERS.
 *
 * 1. The envelope is no longer a SPHERE. `spin(true)` is `rotate(1, 'y')`
 *    (3dmol/src/GLViewer.ts), which PRE-multiplies the view quaternion and so
 *    turns the model about ITS OWN y axis through the rotation centre. The swept
 *    volume is therefore bounded by a CYLINDER about that axis, not by a sphere:
 *    for ethanol 3.734 x 3.129 A against the sphere's 4.196 x 4.196. The sphere
 *    was throwing away a quarter of the frame for nothing.
 *
 * 2. It is a CEILING, not a fill target, and it runs only while the rotation is
 *    actually on. TARGET_FILL is an aesthetic target for the subject; "cannot
 *    clip while spinning" only asks that the swept volume stay INSIDE the canvas.
 *    So both states solve the same per-orientation fit, and the spinning one is
 *    pulled back afterwards only if the sweep would leave the frame.
 *
 * Together those are what close the gap, and the arithmetic says by how much. In
 * the 664 x 514 box the defect was measured in, ethanol's static fit needs
 * 137.2 px/A and its y-axis sweep permits 164.3 — the ceiling does not bind, so
 * the framing while spinning is IDENTICAL to the framing while still and the
 * 27-30% pop is zero. In a 470 x 470 hero box: 125.4 needed against 125.9
 * permitted, also zero. Neither number is a tuned constant; both fall out of the
 * geometry.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT FIXED, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE. With "Hide C–H bonds" on, ethanol's
 * drawn set is four atoms 2.14 A tall, so the fit magnifies to 196.6 px/A, while
 * the swept cylinder is still 3.73 A wide because the radial extreme is the
 * OXYGEN, which hiding keeps. 3.73 A at 196.6 px/A is 735 px in a 664 px box.
 * Filling the frame with the rendered subset and sweeping that subset inside the
 * same frame are then simply incompatible, and engaging the rotation in that
 * sub-state still steps down by ~16%. A brute-force search over 16,000 candidate
 * spin axes says the model y axis is already the best available choice and the
 * best possible one still loses 16.5%, so this is not an axis-selection problem.
 * The alternative — apply the ceiling unconditionally — makes "Hide C–H bonds"
 * SHRINK the molecule (measured in simulation: hero fill 0.809 -> 0.534), which
 * is the older defect this file already fixed once. Ranked: a 16% step in one
 * sub-state beats a 34% shrink in the state people actually use.

 *
 * WHY A CLAMP AND NOT JUST "LET THEM OVERFLOW": at FORCE_ARROW_SCALE = 5 an
 * unrelaxed single-point with forces of a few eV/A draws arrows tens of
 * Angstroms long — several times the size of the molecule. Framing to the
 * atoms alone (which is what frameView now does) stops that from shrinking the
 * molecule, but it does not make the arrows useful: they would leave the canvas
 * entirely and read as four green lines going nowhere. Clamping keeps the whole
 * arrow near the structure it belongs to.
 *
 * The clamp is applied as ONE scale factor shared by every arrow, so relative
 * lengths stay exactly proportional to |F| and the picture still shows which
 * atoms are pushed hardest. What changes is the Angstroms-per-eV/A constant,
 * which is therefore structure-dependent and is printed in the caption — an
 * arrow length that encodes a quantity is not readable without its scale.
 *
 * 0.45 of the span puts the longest arrow at a little under half the molecule's
 * own size: unmistakable, and clearly visible against the structure.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLAMP DOES NOT DO, AND THE REGRESSION THAT PROVED IT. An earlier
 * version of this note claimed 0.45 "mostly fits in the margin TARGET_FILL
 * leaves (0.09 of the box per side, i.e. ~0.11 of the atom span)". 0.45 is four
 * times 0.11, so the claim was arithmetically false, and hiding the C-H
 * hydrogens is what exposed it. Hiding them shrinks the FITTED set (ethanol's
 * silhouette 3.07 A -> 2.14 A) so the fit magnifies by 1.434x — reproduced from
 * the coordinates, and the critic measured 1.44x. The arrows are excluded from
 * the fit by design and their length in ANGSTROMS did not change, so their
 * on-screen length grew by that same 1.434x: measured 588 CSS px of arrow bbox
 * in a 664 px box became ~842 px, i.e. clipped at BOTH edges, which is exactly
 * what was reported ([0, 1327] on a 1328 px backing store).
 *
 * Note what this rules out: the hypothesis that the hidden hydrogens were still
 * being drawn. If they were, the post-hide silhouette would be the ALL-atom one
 * at the C/O fit — 604 px tall in a 514 px box, clipped top and bottom. The
 * measured vertical extent did not move (842 -> 844 backing px, i.e. 421 -> 422
 * CSS px, which is the C/O fit's own 421 px). setStyle(sel, {}) does remove the
 * geometry (GLModel.setStyle assigns `style = {}` when `add` is falsy, and every
 * draw path is gated on a style key), so nothing is drawn for them.
 *
 * The clamp cannot be made airtight by geometry alone, and it is worth saying
 * why rather than tuning the constant again: it is scaled by the structure's own
 * span, and the fit is scaled by the PROJECTED silhouette. Those differ by an
 * unbounded factor — a linear molecule end-on has a tiny silhouette and a large
 * span, so the fit zooms in arbitrarily far while the clamp does not move. For
 * ethanol the two are not even distinguishable by the drawn set: the atom
 * farthest from the centroid is the HYDROXYL hydrogen (1.834 A), which hiding
 * C-H keeps, so re-basing this clamp on the drawn atoms alone would change
 * nothing at all. Hence ARROW_TIP_SAFE_FILL below: a measured ceiling, in screen

/**
 * Fit the ATOMS to TARGET_FILL of the canvas, centred on their projected
 * bounding box. zoomTo() first (it centres the model in model space and sets
 * the slab), then measure the projected silhouette, re-centre it and correct
 * the zoom. Measuring after each correction absorbs perspective
 * non-linearity and representation changes, so the same code frames a 9-atom
 * molecule and a 300-atom slab without clipping either. Used on load, on
 * representation change, on resize and on "reset view", so framing never
 * differs between them.
 *
 * WHY RE-CENTRE, AND WHY IT IS SAFE: see the TARGET_FILL note and
 * setFramingPan. zoomTo() centres the atoms' CENTROID, which is not the centre
 * of the projected silhouette at an arbitrary rotation. Fitting the
 * centroid-symmetric envelope (the old behaviour) is the only way to guarantee
 * no crop WITHOUT re-centring, and it costs exactly the asymmetry in fill — up
 * to 27% of the target, measured. Re-centring first makes the symmetric
 * envelope equal to the true extent, so no-crop and fill-the-frame stop being
 * in tension.
 *
 * Pan and zoom do not fight each other: zoom() moves rotationGroup along the
 * camera axis, which scales the pan offset and the silhouette by the same
 * factor, so a pan solved before a zoom is still correct after it. That is why
 * two passes normally converge.
 *
 * The final pass is two no-crop CEILINGS rather than a fit, and neither of them
 * can ever zoom IN:
 *   1. the SYMMETRIC atom envelope (max of |min| and |max| per axis), so
 *      "nothing is ever clipped at this orientation" stays a checked property of
 *      the final state even if the pan was clamped or did not converge;
 *   2. while auto-rotate is on, the SPIN SWEEP (measureSpinSweep), so "nothing
 *      can clip at any rotation angle" is a checked property too. It is a ceiling
 *      and not a second fit, which is what lets the spinning and still framings
 *      come out identical whenever it does not bind — see SWEEP_SAFE_FILL.
 * Both are folded into one zoom-out so the two cannot fight.
 *
 * WHAT THE GUARDS DO NOT COVER, stated rather than implied:
 *   - the fit is solved for the orientation it is called at, and nothing
 *     re-frames while the USER drags, so dragging by hand can still push part of
 *     the structure out of frame. "Reset view" is the way back, and it resets the
 *     orientation too;
 *   - FORCE ARROWS are bounded per-orientation (measureArrowCeiling), not per
 *     sweep. Folding the tips into the sweep would make `showForces` change the
 *     molecule's size, which is a defect this file already fixed. So while
 *     spinning, an arrow tip can pass outside the frame at some angles. The
 *     arrows are the overlay; the structure is the subject.
 *
 * Returns the metrics of the final state, or null if it was never measurable.

          NO background and NO border. The canvas is transparent
          (backgroundAlpha 0), so whatever sits here shows through — and a
          white well made that transparency a pixel-level no-op: the well
          painted exactly the white the opaque canvas used to paint, measured
          identical. Stacking an elevated surface inside a secondary surface on
          the page tint gave three backgrounds and two borders around the
          molecule, which read as a screenshot in a box rather than an object
          on the page. The bar's wrapper is a bare rounded box with no fill and
          no border. Callers own the surface.

          SHAPE: aspect-square, capped at 520 px tall, instead of a fixed 420.
          At 375 px the old box was 291x420 portrait; the fit binds on the
          291 px axis, so the molecule reached 48% of the height and 11% of the
          area and the rest was scroll. Square wastes none of it and keeps the
          molecule the same size on screen. On a wide results column the height
          cap keeps it from becoming a full-page square. The bar uses
          `aspect-square w-full max-w-md`.

          WEAS takes a pixel height rather than filling its parent, so in WEAS
          mode the box stays auto-height and the same 260-520 band is applied
          to the iframe instead (weasHeight). */}

            gesture it normally owns. When it IS armed it swallows the drag,
            which is why Ctrl-drag no longer pans (3Dmol binds pan to ctrlKey as
            well as to middle-drag; middle-drag still pans). Any button is
            accepted, because on macOS Ctrl+click is a SECONDARY click — the
            pointerdown arrives with button 2 — and the context menu is
            suppressed for the same reason.

            The sticky mode is the TOUCH route: a touch device has no modifier
            key, so Ctrl/Cmd-drag is unreachable there. Pointer events fire for
            touch, so a one-finger drag over this overlay draws the same

            manual: 64 px tall on desktop, 96 px at 375 px, and on the landing
            page it was the LOWEST element above the fold — the hero's last word
            was an instruction sheet for a control the reader had not touched
            yet. The reference embed shows zero instructions. So the list moves
            behind an affordance and the hero reclaims the space outright: with
            no forces to legend (the hero has none) the caption below now renders
            nothing at all.

            costs no layout at all. Bottom-RIGHT because bottom-left is the

/*
 * ============================================================================
 * DOCUMENTATION: Dual-Engine Viewer (3Dmol.js + WEAS)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * OVERVIEW:
 *   The viewer supports two rendering engines that users can toggle between:
 *
 *   1. 3Dmol.js — Full-featured viewer with:
 *      - Ball-and-stick, stick, spacefill representations
 *      - Force vector arrows (green, scaled)
 *      - Auto-rotate (spin), reset view, fullscreen
 *      - Atom / bond selection with distance, angle and dihedral readout
 *      - Hide C–H bonds, PNG export
 *      Loaded from npm (3dmol package), rendered via direct DOM control.
 *
 *   2. WEAS — ml-peg compatible viewer with:
 *      - Ball-and-stick rendering
 *      - XYZ and CIF format support
 *      - Trajectory support (future)
 *      - Same look as https://ml-peg.stfc.ac.uk
 *      Loaded from CDN (unpkg.com/weas), rendered in a sandboxed iframe.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE WHICH:
 *   - 3Dmol.js: Default. Use when you need force arrows or advanced controls.
 *   - WEAS: Use when you want ml-peg compatibility or plan to integrate with
 *     the MACE team's tooling.
 *
 * TOOLBAR LAYOUT:
 *   [3Dmol | WEAS] | [Ball-and-stick | Stick | Spacefill] | [Forces] [Reset]
 *   [Gear] | [Fullscreen]
 *   The gear menu holds Rotate structure, Hide C–H bonds, Box-select mode,
 *   Clear selection and Download PNG — the bar's own menu is Rotate structure /
 *   Manage molecule view / Hide C–H bonds / Download PNG. "Manage molecule
 *   view" is the representation switcher, which stays visible in the toolbar
 *   here.
 *   ON THE CANVAS, not in the toolbar: the "?" gesture list (bottom-right) and
 *   the box-select badge (bottom-left). Both are there because the toolbar row
 *   already wraps at 375 px, so anything added to it can cost a row of height —
 *   and the "?" exists to RECLAIM height. Do not migrate them into the toolbar.
 *
 * TOUCH:
 *   Every control switches to a 44 px hit target when the device reports no
 *   fine pointer (see HIT_SQUARE), and the "?" popover swaps to a touch gesture
 *   list. Do NOT put right-drag, middle-drag, Ctrl/Cmd or Esc back into the
 *   shared copy: a touch device can perform none of them. 3Dmol's touch handling
 *   is one finger to rotate, two to pinch-zoom, three to pan
 *   (GLViewer._handleMouseMove, branching on ev.targetTouches.length); there is
 *   no native touch gesture for box-select, which is why box-select is a MODE in
 *   the gear menu rather than a gesture in the list.
 *
 * WHERE THE GESTURE LIST LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CAPTION:
 *   Behind a "?" in the bottom-right of the canvas. It used to be printed under
 *   the viewer permanently — four 12px monospace lines, 64 px tall, six lines and
 *   96 px at 375 px, and on the landing page it was the lowest element above the
 *   fold. A hero should not end in an instruction sheet for a control the reader
 *   has not touched; the reference embed shows no instructions at all. Only the
 *   force-vector legend is still printed below the viewer, and only when there
 *   are arrows to legend — so a viewer with no forces (the landing hero) now has
 *   no caption whatsoever. Do not put the gestures back into the caption.
 *
 * SELECTION & MEASUREMENT:
 *   Click an atom to select it: its own geometry is repainted in the accent
 *   green and a translucent shell is drawn just outside it. The recolour is what
 *   carries the highlight — a translucent shell alone was measured at a green
 *   channel only 2 above red and blue over a Jmol carbon, which reads as
 *   darkening rather than as green. Clicking a bond selects both of its atoms.
 *   Ctrl/Cmd-drag (or gear > Box-select mode, which is the touch route)
 *   box-selects. 2 atoms give a distance in Å, 3 an angle in degrees about the
 *   middle atom, 4 a signed dihedral in degrees — selection ORDER sets the
 *   vertex and the sign, so the selection is a list, not a set. Two atoms are
 *   only called a "bond length" when 3Dmol's distance-based perception actually
 *   put a bond there; otherwise the readout says "Distance" and says why. MACE
 *   gives no bond orders and none are invented here.
 *
 * FILES:
 *   - molecule-viewer-3d.tsx (this file) — Main viewer with engine toggle
 *   - weas-viewer.tsx — WEAS iframe wrapper component
 *
 * RENDER SETTINGS — DO NOT DROP WHEN ADDING FEATURES:
 *   The ViewerSpec passed to createViewer() carries five deliberate options:
 *   `antialias` + `upscale` (>= 2x backing store), `outline` (dark contact
 *   outline), `ambientOcclusion` (soft contact shading) and `hoverDuration`.
 *   Together with frameView(), repStyle()'s white-capped CPK scheme and the
 *   theme-derived background, these are the render-quality bar from
 *   docs/v2/bars/rowan.md.
 *
 * FRAMING — WHY THE PAD IS PER-ATOM:
 *   See drawnRadius() and measureProjectedExtent(). The short version: a
 *   single shared "largest radius" pad overestimates the silhouette by
 *   (largest radius - outermost atom's radius), which grows with the
 *   representation's bulk, so the solver under-zoomed most where the atoms
 *   were fattest and spacefill came out SMALLER than ball-and-stick. Do not
 *   reintroduce a single shared pad, and do not special-case spacefill.
 *
 * FRAMING — WHAT THE FIT IS SOLVED FOR, AND WHAT IT IGNORES:
 *   Five rules, each of which was a measured defect before it was a rule.
 *   1. Fit the ATOMS. Force arrows are not probed and the framing effect is not
 *      keyed on `showForces`, so toggling the arrows cannot change the
 *      molecule's size by even a pixel. Feeding arrow TIPS to the solver is
 *      what left the default result view at 12% of the box width.
 *   2. Bound the arrows instead, with ONE shared scale so lengths stay
 *      proportional to |F|, and print the resulting Å-per-eV/Å in the legend.
 *      The bound is MEASURED in screen space (ARROW_TIP_SAFE_FILL), because a
 *      structure-relative clamp cannot work: the clamp scales with the span and
 *      the fit scales with the projected silhouette, and hiding five C–H
 *      hydrogens magnified the fit 1.43x while leaving the arrows' Angstroms
 *      alone, which clipped them at both edges of the canvas.
 *   3. Re-centre on the projected bounding box, via rotationGroup's post-
 *      rotation x/y offset (setFramingPan) — NOT translateScene, which would
 *      turn rotate() into an orbit.
 *   4. Handle auto-rotation as a CEILING, not as a second fit. Both states solve
 *      the same per-orientation fit; while spinning, the swept cylinder about the
 *      model's own y axis (the axis spin(true) turns about) must additionally fit
 *      the canvas. Where it already does — the default view, 137 px/Å needed
 *      against 164 permitted — the two framings are identical and there is no
 *      pop. Fitting a rotation-invariant SPHERE to TARGET_FILL instead is what
 *      cost 27% of the apparent size the instant auto-rotate was engaged.
 *      See SWEEP_SAFE_FILL, including what this still does not fix.
 *   5. Never let a ceiling zoom IN. Ceilings only ever pull the fit back.
 *
 * SPECULAR HIGHLIGHTS — SETTLED, DO NOT RE-OPEN:
 *   An earlier round listed "no gloss" as a gap needing a 3Dmol fork. It is
 *   not a gap. The bar was measured pixel-by-pixel and has no specular term
 *   either: its brightest pixel anywhere in the molecule is 242/255 and zero
 *   pixels reach 245. What reads as gloss there is a hard dark contour over a
 *   flat mid-grey fill — a graphic-design effect, not a shading model. Our
 *   render is already the more strongly lit of the two (carbon spans ~117
 *   luminance levels against the bar's ~34).
 *
 *   Forking 3Dmol to add a specular term would therefore buy no visible
 *   quality AND would actively regress the white-ceiling fix above, since a
 *   specular lobe adds exactly the blown-out near-background pixels that
 *   WHITE_CEILING exists to prevent. Rejected on measurement, not on effort.
 *
 * FUTURE ml-peg INTEGRATION:
 *   Using the same WEAS viewer as ml-peg means structures will look identical
 *   in both tools. A future "Browse ml-peg structures" feature could load
 *   benchmark structures directly into this viewer.
 *   See: https://github.com/ddmms/ml-peg
