  /**
   * FRAMING POLICY.
   *
   * `/r/<id>/embed` exists to be dropped into someone else's page — the whole
   * point of the primitive (docs/v2/bars/rowan.md; the bar embeds exactly this
   * in its own homepage hero). Everything else must not be framable
   * cross-origin.
   *
   * Before this block the app sent no framing headers at all, so EVERY page —
   * including /calculate, which uploads files and runs jobs — could be framed
   * by any site. This is therefore a tightening, not a relaxation: the site
   * gains `frame-ancestors 'self'`, and one read-only path is carved out of it.
   *
   * Why the carve-out is safe for that path: it renders a public, read-only
   * calculation that `/r/<id>` already serves to anyone with the URL. There is
   * no authentication anywhere in this app, no cookie or token to ride along
   * with a framed request, and no state-changing control on the page — so there
   * is no privileged action for a framing site to hijack and nothing it could
   * not fetch directly. Clickjacking needs an action worth stealing.
   *
   * MECHANICS. `X-Frame-Options` has no "any origin" value, so the embed must
   * not receive that header at all — hence the negative lookahead on the
   * site-wide source rather than a permissive override (a later rule can
   * replace a header's value but cannot delete it). The source string mirrors
   * the route at app/r/[id]/embed and `embedPath()` in lib/share.ts; all three
   * spell the path out because next.config cannot import from lib (that module
   * pulls in the Supabase client).
